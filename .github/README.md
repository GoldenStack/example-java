## Install

To install, simply add the library via [JitPack](https://jitpack.io/#GoldenStack/example-java/-SNAPSHOT):

Details for how to add this library with other build tools (such as Maven) can be found on the page linked above.
``` gradle
repositories {
    ...
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
}

dependencies {
    ...
    implementation 'com.github.GoldenStack:example-java:-SNAPSHOT'
}
```

## Usage

This is meant for personal use, so it's not intended for anyone else to work with it.

However, to set it up, all you really need to do is copy the files, change this README to be accurate, and add it to
[cla-assistant](https://cla-assistant.io/).
